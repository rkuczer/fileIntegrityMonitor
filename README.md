# File Integrity Monitor
## Introduction

 In this project, I create a file integrity monitor that protects data integrity. It creates a baseline for a file and monitors it and continuously checks for any change based off the hash of the file. If a change is detected it will notify the user. This concept can be used for entire hard drives or a single file.

Here is the architecure of the file monitor which explains how it works from a visual perspective.

## In action

From the script we can see that when the file is altered after a baseline is created the user is alerted.
