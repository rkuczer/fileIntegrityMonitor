# File Integrity Monitor
## Introduction

 In this project, I create a file integrity monitor that protects data integrity. It creates a baseline for a file and monitors it and continuously checks for any change based off the hash of the file. If a change is detected it will notify the user. This concept can be used for entire hard drives or a single file.
